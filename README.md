These are all examples of Bash, Powershell, and Python scripts that I've built over the years of working on various IT Engineering positions. All examples posted here are (or were) production code that I assembled (or wrote from scratch), tested, and implemented. 
Feel free to use snippets or learn different code tricks from my work!
